# Deep-Learning-for-Light-Field-Microscopy
Light-field Microscopy has emerged as a type of scanless, high-speed, 3D imaging tool. We propose model-based explainable deep learning approaches for LFM imaging, which integrates wave-optics theory, sparse representation and non-linear optimization with the artifcial neural network.
